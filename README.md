# centroid-backend
Identify the Center and the Centroid of an Image

## Abstract
The centroid and the center of shapes with radial symmetry exist at the same point in space. However, for irregular shapes this is not true. This small python function will take any 2D shape and output with both of these points rendered on the original shape.
